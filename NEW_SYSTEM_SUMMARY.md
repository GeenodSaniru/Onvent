# ONVENT - New System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This document summarizes the complete rebuild of the ONVENT event ticket booking system. The new implementation addresses all the issues identified in the previous version and follows modern best practices for both backend and frontend development.

## 🏗️ What We've Built

### Backend (Spring Boot 3 + Java 21)
1. **Clean Architecture**: 
   - Organized codebase under `ac.nsbm.onvent.newsystem` package
   - Separated concerns with Controller → Service → Repository → Entity pattern
   - Modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Session-based authentication with Spring Security
   - Role-based access control (USER and ADMIN roles)
   - Password encryption with BCrypt
   - CSRF protection for SPA applications
   - Secure session management with timeout configuration

3. **Data Management**:
   - JPA entities matching existing database schema
   - Spring Data JPA repositories for data access
   - DTOs for API communication
   - Validation with Jakarta Bean Validation

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - RESTful API with proper HTTP methods
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Pagination for large data sets
   - Search and filtering capabilities

5. **Security Features**:
   - CORS configuration for frontend integration
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure credential storage
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities

### Frontend (React.js + Vite)
1. **Modern UI/UX**:
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Component-based architecture
   - Intuitive navigation with React Router
   - Consistent design system with color palette

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Secure login and registration forms
   - Protected routes with role-based access
   - Session management with localStorage
   - User-friendly error handling

3. **Event Management**:
   - Event browsing with search and filters
   - Event details view
   - Ticket booking interface
   - User dashboard for managing bookings

4. **Admin Features**:
   - Event management (CRUD operations)
   - Booking overview
   - Dashboard with statistics

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Code splitting with Vite
   - Efficient state management
   - Optimized API calls with Axios
   - Form validation with React Hook Form

## 🚀 How to Run the System

### Backend Setup
1. Ensure you have Java 21 installed
2. Update database credentials in `src/main/resources/application-new.properties`
3. Update email configuration for booking notifications
4. Run the application (uses Maven wrapper - no Maven installation required):
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
5. The backend will start on port 8087

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/onvent-new
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The frontend will start on port 5174

### Accessing the Application
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5174`
2. Register a new user account
3. The first user will automatically become an ADMIN
4. Other users will have USER role by default

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - Users can register with username, email, name, and password
   - Password validation ensures security requirements
   - First user automatically gets ADMIN role

2. **Login**:
   - Users can login with username/email and password
   - Session is created upon successful authentication
   - Users are redirected based on their role

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - USER role can access user dashboard and book tickets
   - ADMIN role can access admin dashboard and manage events
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Color Palette
- Primary: #1E40AF (Deep Blue)
- Secondary: #3B82F6 (Sky Blue)
- Background: #F9FAFB (Light Gray)
- Text: #1F2937 (Charcoal)
- Accent: #22C55E (Green)

### Responsive Design
