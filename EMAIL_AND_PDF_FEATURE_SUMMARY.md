# Email Notification & PDF Ticket Generation Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of email notification and PDF ticket generation features for the Onvent booking system. When a user books a ticket, they will now receive:
1. An email confirmation with the ticket details
2. A PDF attachment of their ticket with a QR code

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Notification Service
- **EmailService.java**: A service class that handles sending emails using Spring Mail
- Configured to work with Gmail SMTP (can be changed in application.properties)
- Sends HTML formatted emails with ticket details
- Attaches the generated PDF ticket to the email

### 2. PDF Ticket Generation Service with QR Code
- **PdfTicketService.java**: A service class that generates PDF tickets using the iText library
- Includes a QR code with ticket information for easy verification
- Creates a formatted ticket with:
  - Event details (name, date, location)
  - Attendee information
  - Booking information
  - Ticket ID and pricing
  - QR code for verification

### 3. Integration with Booking Workflow
- Modified **TicketService.java** to:
  - Generate a PDF ticket with QR code after successful booking
  - Send an email confirmation with the PDF attached
  - Include all relevant booking details in the email

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
1. Spring Boot Starter Mail (for email functionality)
2. iText 7 Core (for PDF generation)
3. Google ZXing (for QR code generation)

### Configuration
Email settings are configured in `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your_app_password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
```

### Key Classes

#### EmailService.java
- Uses JavaMailSender to send emails
- Supports HTML content and file attachments
- Handles email sending exceptions

#### PdfTicketService.java
- Generates professional-looking PDF tickets with QR codes
- Uses iText 7 library for PDF creation
- Uses Google ZXing for QR code generation
- Includes event and attendee information

#### TicketService.java (modified)
- Integrated email and PDF generation into the booking flow
- Sends confirmation email after successful ticket creation

## How It Works
1. When a user books a ticket through the `/tickets/book` endpoint:
   - The ticket is created in the database
   - A PDF ticket with QR code is generated using PdfTicketService
   - An email confirmation is sent using EmailService with the PDF attached

## Testing
The feature has been tested by:
1. Compiling the entire project successfully
2. Verifying that all services are properly autowired

## Future Enhancements
1. Customize email templates
2. Add support for multiple attachments
3. Implement email queuing for better performance
4. Add email tracking and delivery confirmation
