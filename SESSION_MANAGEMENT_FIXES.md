# Session Management Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the session management issue where users were automatically logged out when navigating from the login page to the home page.

## Issues Identified

1. **Session Cookie Configuration**: Default session cookie settings were not optimal for cross-origin requests
2. **Authentication State Management**: Frontend was too aggressive in marking users as logged out
3. **Session Timeout**: No explicit session timeout configuration
4. **Periodic Authentication Checks**: Missing periodic verification of authentication state
5. **Error Handling**: Network errors were incorrectly causing users to be marked as logged out

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Security Configuration (SecurityConfig.java)
- Added session management configuration with maximum sessions limit
- Ensured proper session creation policy

#### Session Configuration (SessionConfig.java)
- Created new configuration class for session management
- Configured cookie serializer with appropriate settings:
  - Cookie name: JSESSIONID
  - Cookie path: /
  - Cookie max age: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
  - SameSite: None (required for cross-origin requests)
  - Secure cookie: false (for development, should be true in production)

#### Application Properties (application.properties)
- Added session timeout configuration: 30 minutes
- Configured session cookie settings:
  - HttpOnly: true (security enhancement)
  - Secure: false (for development)
  - Max age: 1800 seconds

#### Authentication Controller (AuthController.java)
- Added explicit session timeout setting during login
- Ensured proper session creation and security context storage

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Layout Component (Layout.jsx)
- Improved authentication state checking:
  - Only mark as logged out on 401/403 responses, not network errors
  - Added periodic authentication checks every 5 minutes
  - Proper localStorage management for authentication state
- Enhanced error handling for authentication checks

#### Login Component (UserLogin.jsx)
- Added explicit localStorage cleanup on login failure
- Maintained proper redirect logic based on user role

### 3. Dependency Updates

#### Maven Configuration (pom.xml)
- Added Spring Session dependency for enhanced session management

## Technical Details

### Session Configuration
The session is now configured to:
- Timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Use HttpOnly cookies for security
- Allow cross-origin requests with SameSite=None
- Maintain a single active session per user

### CORS Configuration
Updated to ensure:
- Credentials are allowed to be sent
- Both localhost:5173 and localhost:5174 are allowed origins
- Proper headers are set for cross-origin requests

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via /api/auth/login
2. Session is created with 30-minute timeout
3. Security context is stored in session
4. Frontend stores authentication state in localStorage
5. Periodic checks every 5 minutes verify authentication status
6. Session persists across page navigations
7. Explicit logout or 30-minute inactivity terminates session

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. Login and navigate between pages
2. Refresh pages and verify authentication persists
3. Wait 30 minutes and verify automatic logout
4. Explicitly logout and verify session termination
5. Test cross-tab authentication state consistency

### Expected Behavior
- Sessions persist across page navigation and refreshes
- Authentication state is maintained for 30 minutes
- Network errors don't incorrectly terminate sessions
- Explicit logout immediately terminates sessions
- Session cookies are properly managed

## Security Considerations

### Cookie Security
- HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- SameSite=None with proper CORS configuration
- Secure flag should be enabled in production environments

### Session Management
- Single session per user prevents session hijacking
- Proper session invalidation on logout
- Timeout prevents abandoned session attacks

## Configuration Notes

### Development vs Production
- Secure cookies should be enabled in production
- Session timeout can be adjusted based on requirements
- CORS origins should be restricted in production

### Browser Compatibility
- SameSite=None requires secure cookies in modern browsers
- HttpOnly cookies are supported by all modern browsers
- Session storage works across all supported browsers

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise from these changes:

1. Revert SecurityConfig.java session management changes
2. Remove SessionConfig.java
3. Revert application.properties session configuration
4. Revert Layout.jsx and UserLogin.jsx changes
5. Remove Spring Session dependency from pom.xml

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. Implement refresh token mechanism for extended sessions
2. Add session activity tracking for more granular timeout control
3. Implement session clustering for load-balanced environments
4. Add more sophisticated authentication state synchronization
5. Implement session replay protection
